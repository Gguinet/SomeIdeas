* Summarize ideas from Eliezer Yudkowsky podcast.

* AI, Innovation and Economics: I recall reading an article arguing China "weakened" software companies to prevent pool of talents to divert from real tech innovation (hardware, healthcare ...) to so-called "fake" tech innovation (ads, logistics, HR... ) as spearheaded by Meta, Amazon and co. Interestingly, LLM were possible thanks to funding from such companies to i) develop hardware and tools, ii) educate talents and motivate new ones to join the filed iii) provide useful market to AI in "early" days. 
* I bet we'll all have our own trained Assistant in the next 5/10 years. Personalization is finally getting some tools to become interesting, after years where only multi-armed bandits were available. Tons of questions: lifelong learning, plugin, personnal training, feedback process.... One way I see this happening is through a LORA adaption of a shared LLM weight. Incoming

### 02/07:
* What if GPT-4 is actually not that better ? More generally, does it matter or most of the innovation will be around connecting the core block to products ? Or specialization ?
* Could we switch from an API-connected world to a Chatbot-connected one ? Jere a generalist chatbot asks to experts chatbot or to search engine answers to question and aggregates results.
* Is the data generation bottleneck going to be solved by Chatbot generating artificial discussions and content. Derive economics using this [data](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1631485296754987014.html?utm_source=tldrai).
* Write a bit more on what this unlocks for personalization, finaly moving beyond old and boring recommander systems.
